    "3. bytearray: this is a mutable flavor of the bytes type. this is a variant of bytes, which is mutable, and so supports in-place changes. The bytearray type supports the usual string operations that str and bytes do, but also has many of the same in-place change operations as lists (e.g., append() and extend(), and assignment to indexes). Assuming your strings can be treated as raw bytes, bytearray finally adds direct in-place mutability for string data"
